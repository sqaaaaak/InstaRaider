Since then it's been cloned thousands of times and used for awesome stuff like quickly gathering lots of images to train machine learning algorithms and probably not-so-awesome stuff like downloading Instagram model pictures. I'm glad that people have found it useful and have forked InstaRaider and contributed over that time, however, I don't have the time or the interest in continuing to maintain this project. As with any web scrapping application, stuff is bound to change and break over time. I will still accept pull requests that fix any major issues, but if somebody else is interested in taking over this project please let me know. I have opened an issue (https://github.com/akurtovic/InstaRaider/issues/65) to be used for disucssion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**DISCLAIMER:**\r\n\r\nThis code is posted for informational purposes only.

If InstaRaider fails due to selenium or firefox driver issues, update selenium with:\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install -u selenium\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe first time you use InstaRaider for a specific username, it will download all the photos on that user's profile.\r\nOn subsequent uses, InstaRaider will only download new photos (unless you rename or remove the photos from the Images directory for that specific username). \r\n```python\r\nusage: instaRaider.py [-h] [-n imageCount] USERNAME ./DIRECTORY/TO/SAVE/IMAGES\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output:\r\n```\r\n$ python instaRaider.py -n 100 username ./images/username\r\nusername has 263 posts on Instagram.\r\nThe first 100 of them will be downloaded.\r\nLoading Instagram profile...\r\nSaving photos to ./images/username\r\nDownloaded file 1/100 (123.jpg).\r\nDownloaded file 2/100 (456.jpg).\r\n...\r\nDownloaded file 100/100 (789.jpg).\r\nSaved 100 files to ./images/username\r\n```\r\n### Multiprocessing performance\r\nAfter 3 independent tests ran on the same machine, for a profile with 565 posts, the script took the following time to run depending on the number of processes ran:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/ac20ba470493435\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://thumbnails113.imagebam.com/47050/ac20ba470493435.jpg\" alt=\"imagebam.com\"></a> \r\n\r\n### License:\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 Amir Kurtovic.
